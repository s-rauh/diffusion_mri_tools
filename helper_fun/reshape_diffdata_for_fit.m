% Function to reshape diffusion data to a bval x n array for data fitting.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
%   -   data
%   -   b-values
%
% Output:
%   -   diffdata
%       Reshaped diffusion data
%       The first dimension is the b-value and the second dimension 
%       contains the data. 
%   -   data_sz
%       The original array size (data_sz) is returned to allow reshaping 
%       of the data. 
%   -   Optional:
%       The b-value dimension can be returned (varargout{1}).
%       Permutation vector can be returned (varargout{2}).
