% Function to calculate the signal from a DTI measurement given the
% diffusion tensor. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input values: 
%   - diffusion tensor:     given as n x 7 vector
%                           The first entry of the diffusion vector is S0. 
%                           Order of the tensor elements tensor(2:7): 
%                           Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz
%
%   - b-matrix:             given as (n x 6 vector)
% 
% The signal is calculated according to S = S0*exp(-bmat*diff_tensor)
