% Function to calculate the diffusion signal given the lower triangular 
% matrix (from the Cholesky decomposition) of the diffusion tensor. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input values: 
%   -   lower triangular matrix of the diffusion tensor 
%   -   b-matrix
% The diffusion tensor and b-matrix are given as n x 6 element vectors. The
% first entry of the diffusion tensor is the S0 signal. 
% 
% First, the diffusion tensor is calculated from the lower triangular
% matrix using the function lower_triangular2tensor. 
% Then, the signal is calculated according to S = S0*exp(-bmat*diff_tensor)
