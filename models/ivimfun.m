% Function to calculate the IVIM signal given the IVIM parameters and
% b-values. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input values:
%   - params:           vector containing the IVIM parameters in the order
%                       [S0, D, f, Ds]
%
%   - bval:             b-values
%                       In case of standard IVIM signal calculation, bval
%                       needs to be a vector containing the b-values. 
%                       In case of two-step IVIM fitting, bval is a
%                       structure with fields bval.D_fix (fixed value for
%                       the diffusion coefficient) and bval.bval (diffusion
%                       b-values). 
%
% The signal is calculated according to 
% S = S0*(f*exp(-b*Ds) + (1-f)*exp(-b*D))
